The cpp-bestpractices port provides an interface target that adds strict
compiler warnings to your project.

To use it, add the following to your CMakeLists.txt:

    find_package(cpp-bestpractices CONFIG REQUIRED)
    target_link_libraries(my-target PRIVATE cpp-bestpractices::cpp-bestpractices)

Replace `my-target` with the name of your target (e.g., your executable or library).
This will apply flags like -Wall, -Wextra, -Wpedantic (for GCC/Clang)
or /W4 (for MSVC) to your target.
